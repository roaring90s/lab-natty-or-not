# Into The Future - A podcast clip with Rachel 

## 📒 Description
Rachel discusses about the human future when it comes to technological advance and more in this nearly 5 minute long clip.

## 🤖 Technologies
- Generative AI **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)** for script and review;
- Generative AI **[ElevenLabs](https://www.elevenlabs.io)** to clone and synthetize the narrator's voice;
- Software **[Descript](https://www.descript.com)** to edit and improve the clip.

## 🧐 Creative process
I decided to target this podcast to an english-speaker audience, using Chat GPT to generate the script in a less formal and more familiar tone, then synthetizing the best fitting voice with ElevenLabs and finally editing and adding final touches to the clip with Descript.

## 🚀 Results
By the end of the experiment, i had a very informal and even funny shortclip of this fictional podcast talking briefly about AIs.

## 💭 Reflection
The challenge was really interesting and fun, get to play with different voices and tones was the coolest part.
